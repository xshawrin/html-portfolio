  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Graduate with focus in graphic design. I have developed creative ideas and concepts with art directors. And Visualized and developed identity for brand including web presence. Currently student at Södertörn university, Masters in User Experience and Interactive Media Design. That includes UX Research, Analysis, Wireframing, User Flows, User Journey Mapping, UI Prototype Design and Usability Testing. In all my study and work, I seek to simplify the relationship between user and the interactive products they use, taking into consideration business goals and technological constraints. I'm not afraid about the new and the different, I like to face new challenges, if something is too difficult to solve, I’d like to think in many different perspectives to find a solution that will fit best.</p>
